Describe any challenges you faced this week: The challenge for me this week was mostly just deciding what else I wanted to add to my website to make it look even better. Also I have a hard time figuring out good color schemes so my figma mockup doesn't look as great as I hoped but I am here to learn.

How did you solve them?: Mostly just looking up ideas on places such as Pinterest. 

What are you most proud of?: I think my website mockup actually looks really good and I am very proud of myself for remembering how to do certain things that I think made it look super good such as the background. 

How are you doing?: I am having so much fun in this class and I genuinely can't wait to put together my own website for my art. 

What can I do specifically to support you as we continue?: I don't really know, everything you've provided in the lessons has been really helpful to the point I don't really need any extra support so far.

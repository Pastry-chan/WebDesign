# Unwind

## A novel by Neal Shusterman

Neal Shusterman is one of my favorite authors because he has such unique ideas and plot twists. Scythe and Unwind are two of my favorite series. Unwind was the first book I read by him. It takes place in the future where unwanted kids under 18 are sent to facilities where they are dissected and their body parts used for various things. We follow a few different characters whose stories all mash into one by the end. It is an amazing novel and I will always recommend it when I have a chance to talk about what novel I love.

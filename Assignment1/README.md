#Assignment 1 re-done

My peer review feedback on assignment 1 mostly consisted of people advising me to make the background lighter than the header in order to make it pop. This was a very good idea so I kept this in mind.

When I re-did assignment one I wanted to keep the peer review advice in mind while also trying to practice what I've learned in other classes. I added a background image from the manga but made sure the heading was still darker than the image to make it pop. I made the text light so then it's easy to read. I also included a button to the manga for people to reac if they were interested. I wanted to make the about information and chapter in their own containers so then it's easier to seperate them an just a page divider line. I also included some little images next to the text to make it more fun to look at.

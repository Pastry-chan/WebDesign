        <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Dorohedoro is a manga about a man who is trying to find the wizard that turned his head into a lizard head. It is a dark and gritty manga but it is amazing. One of the main reasons why I love Dorohedoro so much is because of the unique art style. The author has a very scratchy style and I have always dealt with messy lineart in my art due to my hand tremors and her artsyle made me feel more confident as an artist</p>
